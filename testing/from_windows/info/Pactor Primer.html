<p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">This document is intended as a guide
for the mobile ham who is new to the world of message forwarding via the
ham radio HF Pactor network. It is written by the author of the AirMail
personal mailbox program, primarily for cruising sailors and RV travelers
that want to stay in touch via amateur radio and email. Subjects covered
include advice on equipment selection and installation, getting started
with the AirMail program and getting connected to the Pactor network. The
last section also covers doing it the hard way, using a dumb terminal program.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The biggest problem with getting started
with Pactor is documentation. The Pactor controllers all come with thick
manuals which cover a multitude of operating modes, but by the time you
painfully extract the part that is relevant to Pactor you find the documentation
to be pretty thin. Our advice is to treat the controller manuals as highly
valued reference documents, sort of like unabridged dictionaries, and don’t
attempt to actually read them unless absolutely necessary.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">A further note on this document: Parts
of it are full of fluff and can be skimmed quickly, but when we get to
the step-by-step instructions on how to get your station on the air, then
you need to slow down and read each word carefully.</font></font>

of the Network</font></font></font></center>


<p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Sending digital communications over
radio is nothing new, but recent advances in technology and software have
made it easier than ever before for mobile hams to stay in touch via ham
radio. Email is almost universal these days, and is ideal for exchanging
messages between mobile hams and their contacts at home. All that is needed
is some method to get messages to a fixed station and from there to the
internet. Thanks to the efforts of a bunch of dedicated system operators
(sysops) and a few software developers, the pieces are all in place.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">In order to exchange email messages
with the folks back home, you will need a suitable radio setup to access
a Mailbox (MBO) station via HF radio, and your contacts will of course
need email access (you don’t need an account yourself). While there are
VHF and satellite packet stations in use, most long-distance traffic is
sent via HF Pactor stations and that is what we are going to focus on here.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">There are literally dozens of HF MBO
stations world-wide, most running the WinLink software package originally
written by Vic Poor W5SMM and rewritten and developed by Hans Kessler N8PGR.
WinLink stations are designed for automatic message forwarding, either
to other WinLink stations via Pactor on the HF bands, or via the VHF packet
network. The real breakthrough for mobile users to be able to keep in touch
with the folks back home was the development of internet email gateways,
and many WinLink stations now also operate internet gateways using the
NetLink software package developed by Jim Jennings W5EUT.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Pactor is a method of sending digital
information via radio, and was developed around 1990 by a small group of
German hams who formed the company SCS. Pactor is an Frequency-Shift Keying
(FSK) based system that incorporates longer blocks than the earlier Amtor
system, robust error checking and automatic switching from 100 baud to
200 baud when conditions permit. The first Pactor controller was developed
by SCS and the protocol was adopted by most other manufacturers of TNC's
(Terminal Node Controllers, or radio modems), but often without the analog
memory error correction scheme developed by SCS.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The Pactor team at SCS went on to develop
Pactor-2, a two-tone phase-shift encoding (PSK) scheme. Their Pactor-2
controller is the PTC-II, with the modem implemented by a powerful DSP
(Digital Signal Processor) chip and incorporating a fast 32-bit microprocessor
to move the data. The original Pactor mode is also included (and in fact
Pactor-2 operates as a "turbo" mode once contact is established via Pactor).
Amtor, RTTY, Morse and weather fax modes are also provided, plus plug-in
options for VHF/UHF packet.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">A message on the digital ham network
looks a lot like an email message, with a "From" and a "To" address, a
subject line and a message body. Addresses are hierarchical and geographic.
For example KE6RK@OE4XBU.AUT.EU indicates station KE6RK who can be reached
at mailbox station OE4XBU in Austria in Europe. In Theory, a message can
be entered into any BBS or MBO station, addressed to any other, and will
get there by whatever route the MBO stations decide. Similar to email,
the message is not generally delivered to the end user automatically, they
must connect to the BBS or MBO station and collect it.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Passing messages between the ham radio
network and the Internet requires a gateway between an email service and
a ham radio MBO. Each message must carry two addresses, one for the ham
network and a second one for the internet. The NetLink program handles
polling the email server, reformatting the messages, and handing them off
to the WinLink MBO program. There are limitations on the messages that
can be handled, due to the relatively low bandwidth of the ham radio network
and the regulatory limitations associated with ham radio communications.
For ordinary email messages the bandwidth is not a problem and messages
up to 5-10KB are commonly forwarded, and longer messages are possible with
direct links to certain gateways.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The regulatory issues result from the
international agreements that grant amateur radio some prime HF real estate,
on a non-compete basis with commercial carriers. All of the various national
regulatory bodies have implemented prohibitions on commercial messages,
which in the U.S. prohibits any communication in which either party has
a "pecuniary interest" (Part 97.113 of the FCC regulations, revised in
1993). So you can order a pizza via ham radio as long as neither party
works for the pizza parlor. This language applies to U.S. hams operating
/MM in international waters also, but different language may apply in other
countries.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">A second issue is non-ham third-party
traffic, that is messages originated by or addressed to someone who is
not a ham. For mobile hams in international waters or connecting to a U.S.
MBO there are no restrictions and messages may be freely passed, but in
other countries other rules may apply so it pays to check.</font></font>

<center><a name="Choice"></a><font face="Arial"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1">Choice
of Equipment</font></font></font></center>


<p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The only difficult part of setting
up a Pactor station is the variety of equipment that is available, none
of which uses compatible connections. This means that cables need to be
made up especially for each installation, which is the number one source
of problems. (Number two is figuring out the correct transmit frequency).</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Three components are needed to set
up a Pactor station: a radio transceiver (and antenna), a data controller
(also known as a terminal note controller or TNC), and a computer with
some appropriate software. The controller is the only specialized piece
of equipment, and is essentially a radio modem, similar in concept to the
ubiquitous computer modem used for telephone connections. The controller
generates the audio signals that are sent via the radio transmitter, and
decodes the incoming audio signals from the radio receiver. So the primary
connection between the controller and the radio is two audio signals (audio
in and audio out), plus a PTT (push-to-talk) signal to tell the radio when
to transmit.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1">Transceivers</font></font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Transmitting and receiving digital
signals is similar to voice, and most modern SSB radios will do the job
just fine. Ideally, the audio signals to and from the controller will be
line-level (500mv) signals to a rear-panel connector, allowing the radio
to be interchangeably used for digital and voice communications. Some older
radios do not provide a rear-panel "accessory" connector, however, and
the speaker and microphone connectors must be used. The audio level from
the speaker jack will be adequate (although the volume cannot be turned
down too far), but the controller's normal transmit audio may overload
the microphone jack. Depending on the controller there will be a some way
to reduce the transmit level if required.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The second issue is the transmitter's
ability to transmit a continuous full-power signal without melting. Again,
most recent transceivers can do this without a problem, but some older
transmitters will have to be operated at a reduced power setting. This
is generally no big deal, as even 25 watts is enough when conditions are
good and many /MM's (Maritime Mobiles) routinely operate at 25 or 50 watts
just to save the poor batteries.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Two less important issues relating
to the transceiver are filters and a TCXO. A narrow-band (500 Hz) filter
can be handy for reducing interference on the sometimes-crowded ham bands,
but the controllers themselves are very good at ignoring adjacent-channel
interference. The only time it becomes an issue is the rare case when a
strong adjacent signal activates the receiver's AGC and reduces the level
of all signals. Bottom line, if you have a narrow filter that works in
SSB mode then use it, otherwise don't worry about it.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The TCXO issue relates to the accuracy
of the transceiver's crystal oscillator. With digital signals operating
with only a 200 Hz frequency shift, transmitting and listening on the correct
frequency is a significant issue. Without a temperature-controller crystal
oscillator (TCXO), a typical ham transceiver will drift 50 Hz or more as
it warms up. This is not enough to be detectable on a SSB voice transmission,
but for a digital connection would be significant. Pactor will operate
up to 100 Hz off frequency but is happier (fewer errors) if within half
of that, and Pactor-2 needs to be within 50 Hz. If a TCXO is available
for your transceiver, then we would recommend installing it.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1">The Controller:</font></font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">There are a number of controllers or
TNC's on the market, although the SCS PTC-II and the Kantronics KAM+ are
the most popular with mobile users (and currently the only ones supported
by AirMail). Both are small and relatively low-powered (about 1/3 amp at
12 volts). The KAM+ is a second-generation controller, with a simple micro-controller
and programmable analog filters, and does a good job with all of the basic
modes including Pactor. The SCS PTC-II is a third-generation controller
with a powerful DSP (digital signal processor) to handle the modem functions
plus a 32-bit microprocessor for the digital chores. All the basic modes
are supported plus the new Pactor-2 mode. The choice is economic, with
the PTC-II offering much faster and more robust connections at a significantly
higher cost. There are other controllers that support Pactor also, such
as the PK-232 and MFJ-1278, so if you've got one then use it (AirMail will
shortly support the PK family, plans for the MFJ are uncertain).</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1">The Computer:</font></font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Almost any sort of computer will do
the job. The controllers all have a pretty reasonable command set, and
at the basic level any sort of "dumb terminal" program can be used effectively,
so even the simplest computer is capable of handling digital communications.
For sending more than the occasional message, however, cutting and pasting
messages with a dumb terminal program gets pretty tedious and some sort
of specialized terminal program such as Airmail will make things much easier.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">There are lots of terminal programs
available for DOS, Windows and Mac computers, but most are focused on making
the multiplicity of controller modes easier to use, and are not oriented
toward any specific application. So the value of a conventional terminal
program for the job of sending email via Pactor mailboxes is, in our opinion,
of little value over typing commands directly to the controller with a
dumb terminal program. Being able to cut and paste message text for incoming
and outgoing messages is very handy, so being able to run Windows or having
a Mac is a significant advantage.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The key to making software programs
easier to use is to focus on doing one application well and not try to
do everything. And that is why we wrote AirMail. It is a Windows-95 program
with a good set of email-style tools for sending and receiving messages
via HF Pactor using the PTC-II or KAM controllers (and soon the PK-232),
and that's about all.</font></font>

<center><a name="Installation"></a><font face="Arial"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1">Installation
Basics</font></font></font></center>


<p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">There are three cables required to
get a controller hooked up: a data cable to the computer, an audio cable
to the radio, and a power cable to a 12-volt supply. The data cable sometimes
comes with the controller or can be purchased at the computer store. The
PTC-II box has a 9-pin female connector with the same pin-out as the 9-pin
male found on most PC's, and the KAM has a 25-pin female connector, so
both of those are standard computer-store cables. The PK-232 cable is weird
and will probably have to be made up special.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The audio cable will have four wires:
transmit audio from the controller to the transceiver, receive audio from
the transceiver to the controller, a push-to-talk (actually "ground-to-transmit")
connection, and ground. The cable must shielded, with the shield connected
to the connector shell at each end. The pin connections are different for
each controller and each radio, so generally a cable must be made up specially
for each configuration. If the radio has a rear-panel "Accessory" connector
then that should be the first choice, otherwise the front-panel microphone
connector can be used. An accessory jack provides line-level input and
outputs and (on most radios) disables the microphone when the rear-panel
"PTT" connection is activated.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">If you use the microphone connector,
you might find a speaker or audio-out connection on same connector, otherwise
a rear-panel speaker or audio-out connector can be used. You do not want
to disable the speaker completely, however, as it is very important to
be able to listen on a frrequency before transmitting. Also consider the
TNC/microphone switch (http://www.mfjenterprises.com/mfj/switches/tncmic.html)
and thanks to W2WJY for this hint.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">And whatever connection you use, be
sure that the transmitter audio is not being over-driven, particularly
with Pactor-2 (a PTC-II controller). The audio distortion will dramatically
reduce the effectiveness of the signal as well as making you a very bad
neighbor on the ham bands. The way to check is with the ALC meter, you
want it well into the "green", towards the bottom of the dial. Also be
sure that any speech compression is turned off for the same reason. You
may be able to adjust the transmit audio with the Mic gain control, sometimes
there in an internal adjustment, or you can adjust it at the controller
(The PTC-II uses the PKSA and FSKA commands, the KAM has a jumper, and
the PK-232 has a rear-panel trim pot).</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The PTC-II controller uses an 8-pin
DIN connector for its HF audio connections, although all of the interesting
signals are on pins 1 to 5 so a 5-pin DIN connector will work just fine.
And in fact the German pin layout for an 8-pin connector does not match
the geometry of the American pin layout, so if you melted the original
connector trying to solder it then a 5-pin connector is the safe replacement.
The 5-pin connectors from Radio Shack also don’t melt as easily as the
German ones.</font></font>

<font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The pin numbering for DIN connectors is
goofy, so check the manual carefully for the pin locations. Some DIN connectors
are also prone to melting while being soldered, so use a clip-in heatsink
(or hemostat) on the other end of the pin while soldering, and work quickly.</font></font>

</font></p><p><font face="bookman old style, times new roman, times"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The power connector used by the PTC-II,
KAM and PK-232 controllers is a 5.5mm x 2.1mm coaxial-pin connector (the
only thing they all agreed on), also available from Radio Shack (if the
controller did not come with one). The center pin is positive, not negative,
and the penalty for wiring it backwards is severe. (Note that the PTC-II
has an alternate 12V input on its HF audio connector but no corresponding
ground return, so we would recommend using the separate power connection
for RFI reasons).</font></font>

</font></p><p><font face="bookman old style, times new roman, times"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1"><b>A few comments on RFI:</b> A transmitter
pumping out 100 watts in digital modes can generate a quite a bit of stray
RF, which often finds its way into the controller and computer cables and
raises all sort of havoc. The PK-232 seems particularly sensitive to RF,
and the PTC-II is pretty immune. A good ground system and shielded cables
are a must, and if either of those are deficient then that's a place to
start. But beyond that it is usually necessary to add some clip-on ferrites
or a coax line isolator to provide RF blocking.</font></font>

</font></p><p><font face="bookman old style, times new roman, times"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Clip-on ferrite chokes are about 1"
long with a 1/4" hole through the middle and act as RF blocks, allowing
normal bi-directional signal flow but blocking any common mode (unidirectional)
RF current such as stray RF flowing on a ground wire or shield. Their primary
function is to break up ground loops and keep the ground currents off of
the signal cables where it will couple into everything. Ferrite chokes
can be particularly useful clipped onto the audio connection between the
PTC-II and the transceiver, ideally one at each end. They are available
from Radio Shack, but a better choice is Fair-Rite p/n 0443164251, available
from <a href="http://www.newark.com/">Newark Electronics</a> as their part#
95F763.</font></font><font point-size="10"> Another choice is the MFJ-701
from <a href="http://www.mfjenterprises.com/">MFJ</a>, an open-frame core
which allows multiple turns of cable but which we don't think is as effective
as the Fair-Rite choke.</font>

</font></p><p><font face="bookman old style, times new roman, times"><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Clip-on ferrites or a ferrite Line
Isolator is also highly recommended between the transceiver and the tuner
(or between the transceiver and antenna if no tuner is fitted). A line
isolator is a much beefier version of a clip-on ferrite choke, and blocks
the stray RF path to ground via the coax shield and transceiver ground,
forcing the antenna currents to use the proper ground strap. An excellent
Line Isolator is model T-4 from </font></font><font point-size="10"><a href="http://www.radioworks.com/">The
Radio Works</a></font><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">, Portsmouth VA
(and their web site also has an excellent discussion on grounding and RF
interference).</font></font>

then move the AirMail folder (and sub-folders) and re-do the shortcuts
from the start menu and the desktop - the program itself is a self-contained
.exe file and is highly portable.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Start the program, answer the callsign
question (no /MM here) and before doing anything else go to Tools/Options
on the menu and check the settings. On the first page be sure the appropriate
controller is selected and the baud rate is correct (we recommend 38400
or 57600 for the PTC-II and 4800 or 9600 for the KAM). Also check "Show
Link Messages" for now (and un-check it later after things get going).
In the radio section, check "none", "LSB", set the Center Frequency to
"2100" and check the "Set Decoder Tones" box. On the next page make sure
your callsign is correct and don't worry about the ID string unless you
want to identify as a "/mm" for example. Click the OK button (not cancel)
to close the Options Window and save the settings.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Now select View/Frequency List from
the menu, that will show the list of all available MBO stations. The check
boxes mark the stations that will appear in the Station list, and don't
forget to save if you made any changes. If you said "What check marks?"
then you need to update the Windows Common Controls Driver (comctl32.dll).
There is a Microsoft update for that called com32upd.exe available at http://www.microsoft.com
or wherever you found the Airmail download. (This update used to be bundled
with Internet Explorer, but is now available separately at the suggestion
of the Justice Department).</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Now open the Terminal Window (F6 or
Window/Terminal on the menu or click the right-most "Terminal Window" button).
Watch the upper screen - after 2-3 seconds it should show a list of setup
commands in red - these are the "Link Messages" that you elected to show
in the Options Window. The status bar at the bottom should also show "Init
OK", but the message is a bit elusive as the same box gets used for hints.
If all that worked then you should be ready to connect.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">AirMail can communicate with the MBO
station in three different modes: BBS mode ("Handshake" button down) is
the default and provides automatic message forwarding both ways, you don't
have to do a thing except make the initial connection; Keyboard mode ("Keyboard"
button down) allows you to enter commands manuall, read bulletins, etc.;
and Unprompted mode (neither button down) is completely manual. There are
also buttons that allow you to get or send messages in Keyboard mode, but
we strongly recommend that you use BBS mode for transferring messages,
as it will save time and allow others more access.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">If you are new to WinLink MBO's, there
are two things we would suggest: First, start with an MBO that isn't particulary
busy. K4CJX runs a geat MBO but is very busy, instead try N8PGR or K7SLI.
Secondly, make your first contact in "Keyboard" mode so you will have a
chance to read the help files and check for bulletins. Once you are up
and running, however, you will want to use BBS mode most of the time.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The next step is to select a station
from the Station pull-down list (on Terminal Window's Toolbar), that chooses
the station that AirMail will try to connect to. (If you don’t pick one
first, AirMail will ask when you try to connect). If you don;t see the
station you want on this list, then close the Terminal Window and go back
up three paragraphs and put a checkmark next to the stations you want to
access.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Once you have selected a station from
the Station List then click the Frequency List to the right access a list
of frequencies scanned by that MBO station. As you move up and down the
list, the dial frequency will be calculated and displayed in the status
bar at the lower-right (and if you had a remote control cable connected
to the transceiver then the frequency would be set automatically - that's
a great feature but one to worry about later). For now you may want to
put the dial frequencies for your favorite MBO into the transceiver's memory
(and remember that the frequency list at the top of AirMail's Terminal
Window shows center frequencies, and the selected dial frequency will be
displayed in the bottom status bar).</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Check all of the frequencies for the
selected MBO, listen carefully and choose a clear frequency on an appropriate
band, and then try connecting to the MBO. If you are trying to connect
to a busy MBO like K4CJX, then you will likely find him busy on another
frequency. In this case either find a less-busy MBO, or wait untill he
signs off with a "SK" message. When you are ready to connect click the
left-most "Green-light" button or select Control/Connect) from the menu).
The controller will call for about a minute before timing out, that is
usually plenty if the propagation is good and the station is not busy on
another frequency. If the MBO doesn't answer then try another frequency
or try some other time - the station may be busy on a another frequency
or there may be no propagation.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">When you get connected to a WinLink
MBO, you will see the welcome message and then a command prompt ending
with a "", that means "Go Ahead". In Keyboard mode you will be in a semi-automatic
mode where you can type commands manually (into the lower keyboard box)
but AirMail will hold each command until it sees the next prompt from WinLink.
Each command is followed by the Enter key, and WinLink will take care of
turning the link around - there is no need for you to initiate a change-over
(and doing so will just confuse everyone).</font></font>

</p><p><font size="-1"><font face="Arial">Enter the <b>H</b> (Help) command into
the lower keyboard box, and WinLink will return a list of commands and
their use. Also try the <b>I</b> (info) command, and enter <b>LB</b> to
get a current list of bulletins. If you want to read any of the listed
bulletins, enter <b>R</b> and the bulletin number, i.e. <b>R 1234</b> to
read bulletin number 1234. If all that works then logoff (enter a <b>B</b>
for Bye) and WinLink will disconnect. If you got this far, then all of
the technical stuff is working, the wires are all hooked right and you
got the frequencies figured out correctly. If the controller isn't working
correctly, then skip ahead to the </font><font face="MS Sans Serif"><a href="http://siriuscyber.net/airmail/pprimer.htm#Terminal">Terminal
Program</a> </font><font face="Arial">section and check it out step-by-step.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">If you got this far then try composing
a test message. Do this by going back to AirMail's main window (F6 to switch
or close the Terminal Window) and click the "New Message" button (or File/New
from the menu). For now, close the Address Book by pressing the <b>Esc</b>
key and then enter <b>"SP CALLSIGN@MBO"</b> on the first line of the new
message, where "CALLSIGN" is your callsign and "MBO" is the callsign of
the MBO that you want to connect to. ("SP" means Send Private and is the
send-message command). The second line is the subject, and the third line
starts the message. Don't worry about adding the "/EX" terminator at the
end, AirMail will do that. When you are done composing the message, click
the "Post" button (or menu File/Post) - that will save the message and
mark it for sending, and return you to the index. Your new message should
be in the index with a "mailbox" icon next to it indicating it waiting
to be sent.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Now go back to the Terminal Window
(F6 again), and this time click the "BBS mode" button (the handshake icon).
Reconnect to the MBO as before, and this time AirMail and WinLink will
exchange system ID's (the square-bracket codes) and handle the transfer
automatically (the keyboard is disabled). Uploads go first in BBS mode,
so your message should first be uploaded to the MBO, and then should immediately
download again (if you addressed it to yourself). WinLink will disconnect
automatically when done. Now go back to the Main Window (F6 again) and
check your new message.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Sending a message to an email gateway
is just as easy. Messages addressed to "Nexus" are routed to the NetLink
internet gate, so start a new message with "SP NEXUS@MBO" on the first
line, where MBO in this case is the nearest WinLink station that has a
Nexus/NetLink gateway. The email address goes on the second line, and the
message subject on the third line. Follow that with the message text and
post it as before. If the gateway is not at the same station that you normally
connect to, then it will be forwarded automatically but you will be prompted
for which MBO you want to send the message to (the "Post-to MBO"). AirMail's
"Post-to" MBO is where the message will first be sent, and the "@MBO" is
where the message will eventually wind up after being forward.</font></font>

</p><p><font size="-1"><font face="Arial">If that all works then it is time to
grab your favorite beverage, sit down with the Help files, and start reading.
If none of this works, try it with a </font><font face="MS Sans Serif"><a href="http://siriuscyber.net/airmail/pprimer.htm#Terminal">Terminal
Program</a></font><font face="Arial"> and then come back here. If the controller
didn’t initialize properly then the baud rate may be wrong, or there may
be a setting that is incompatible with AirMail. It may also be necessary
to restore the default settings if you have been trying other programs,
but in general that should not be necessary more than once (if it is, we
would really like to hear about it so we can fix it). If all else fails
write us with a careful chronology and we'll try to help.</font></font>

<!--msthemeseparator--></p><p align="center"><img src="./Pactor Primer_files/blorulee.gif" width="300" height="10"></p>
<center><a name="Terminal"></a><font face="Arial"><font color="#000080"><font size="+1">Using
a Terminal Program</font></font></font></center>


<p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The first thing to establish is that
the controller is communicating with the computer and that the baud rate
is set to what you think it is. Windows HyperTerminal is a good choice,
it is found under Programs/Accessories in the Start menu, open the HyperTerm
folder and double-click "Hypertrm.exe". You will be prompted for a new
connection, give it a name like "PTC-II" or whatever and click OK. On the
next window change "Connect using" to "Direct to Com 1" or wherever you
have the controller connected and click "OK". The next window is Port Settings,
set the baud rate to 38400 or 57600 for a PTC-II (4800 or 9600 for a KAM
or PK-232, or whatever the controller is set to), 8 data bits, no parity,
1 stop bit and click "OK". Now go to the File menu and select Save to save
the settings, and then exit HyperTerminal and restart it. This time you
will see an icon in the HyperTerminal folder for your controller settings,
double-click that and you should be ready.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1"><b>One very important thing about HyperTerminal:</b>
if you change the port settings (baud rate, etc.) with the File/Properties
menu, you <b>must</b> save the settings, exit the program and re-start
it before your changes will take effect. This "feature" drove us crazy
before a compassionate friend pointed the problem out.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">When you power-on a PTC-II it goes
into a "quiet" auto-baud state and you need to hit the "Enter" key to set
the baud rate and wake it up, you will then see some start-up text and
a "cmd:" prompt. The KAM and PK-232 start right up with the pre-set baud
rate so you should see the start-up message and the "cmd:" prompt - if
it doesn't then you probably have the wrong baud rate. You won’t be able
to set a new baud rate (with the KAM's ABaud command or the PK-232's TBaud
command) until you can communicate using the old rate (sort of a Catch-22)
so some experimentation might be required. A brand-new KAM will come up
in an auto-baud mode, so watch the screen and enter a "*" when prompted.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">If you can communicate with the controller
using HyperTerminal, then you might be up to a basic working level. Unless
you are sure the controller is reset to the default defaults (i.e. it is
brand new), give it a hard reset command just to make sure. And be sure
that the terminal program is set to <b>8 data bits and no parity</b> (HyperTerminal
like to default to 7 bits/even parity - to change it, select File/Properties
from the menu, then click Configure and check the settings, and then restart
the program before doing anything else).</font></font>

</p><p><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial">One very important thing about the
KAM: </font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you start up a new KAM
(or one that you gave a Restore Defaults command), and you have not set
8 bits/no parity, then nothing else will ever work. Trust us on this one.
(We think the same is true for the PK-232).</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="-1">To reset a PTC-II to the
factory defaults, use the <b>RESTART</b> command. The controller will reset
and go back to its auto-baud routine so hit the Enter key and you should
see the start-up text and a "cmd:" prompt. For the KAM, use the <b>RESTORE
DEFAULTS</b> command (spelled out). The controller will then start its
"Auto-baud" thing, so give it an asterisk (*) when it prompts. The PK-232
requires a <b>RESET </b>command to restore its defaults.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Once you see a <b>cmd:</b> prompt,
you should be able to enter controller commands. Commands can be upper
or lower case, and usually only the first few letters need to be typed.
We will indicate the part of the command that is required with capital
letters, and the optional letters with lower case. When you enter the command,
however, you can use either case. Each command is followed with the Enter
key, and (depending on the command) you will usually get an acknowledgement
of some sort and a new <b>cmd:</b> prompt.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The next task is to figure out the
offset between the advertised frequency of the WinLink MBO stations and
your radio dial. We're recommending that you use the radio's lower-sideband
(LSB) mode and set the controller's audio tones to a mark and space frequency
of 2000 and 2200 respectively, that's an audio center frequency of 2100
Hz. (The PK-232 is fixed at a center frequency of 2210 Hz). In SSB mode
the transceiver's dial always reads out the carrier frequency, not the
actual transmitted frequency. The difference is the audio frequency, so
for tones of 2000/2200 and LSB mode, the transceiver dial must be set <b>2.1
KHz above</b> the center frequency of the other station. For most MBO's
this works out to be an even kilohertz. For example K4CJX (a popular WinLink
MBO in the U.S.) operates on an advertised center frequency of <b>14071.9</b>
(among many others), so you would set your dial to <b>14074.00</b>. Simple,
no? Of course there are lots of other possible tone and offset combinations,
and you can also operate USB or RTTY modes (the latter in Pactor-1 mode
only), and once you figure out what you are doing there might be good reasons
for doing so. But for now, that's an unpaved road.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">At this point we are going to split
out the PTC-II users for a few paragraphs while we talk about the commands
appropriate for that controller, so KAM users should skip down a a couple
of paragraphs.</font></font>

</p><p><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial">If you have a PTC-II</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">,
there are a few commands that you probably want to change from the default
settings: Enter the command REMote 0 to turn off remote-control access,
CWid 0 to turn off the CW (Morse) auto-ID (which is not required in most
countries), and CHOBell 0 to turn off the change-over beeper (it will make
you crazy). The way to set the tones to 2000/2200 is by entering the commands
TOnes 2, MARk 2000, and SPAce 2200. You will also need to enter your callsign
with the Mycall command.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The PTC-II is already in Pactor Standby
mode when it powers on, so you are ready to tune around the band and listen
for signals (14065-14080 kHz is prime Pactor real estate). To call another
station, set the frequency and enter the command <b>C N8PGR</b> (for example).
If the other station responds you will see a "link" message from the controller
and then a welcome message and a prompt like <b>"KE6RK de N8PGR&gt;" </b>and
the link will turn around so that you become the sending station.. Proceed
as outlined below "Communicating with WinLink".</font></font>

</p><p><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial">For the KAM,</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
the first thing we need to do after a hard reset is get the unit out of
the "New User" mode. We may be, but it won’t let us set the tones so it's
got to go. Enter the command INtface Term, then set the tones with the
commands SHift Modem, then SPace 3000, MARk 2000, SPace 2200. (With the
KAM the space tone must always be higher than Mark, even when being set,
so setting Space first to a silly-high tone avoids a possible error message).
</font><font face="Arial">To get into Pactor Standby mode, enter the command
<b>PACTOr</b> (with no argument). You can monitor traffic on the air, get
the frequency offsets figured out, etc. To get back to the KAM's <b>cmd:</b>
prompt, type <b>&lt;ctrl-C&gt; X</b> (i.e. control and "C" keys together,
then the "X" key alone). With the KAM, before calling another station,
you first need to return to the <b>cmd:</b> prompt by doing a <b>&lt;ctrl-C&gt;
X</b>. Next, find a WinLink MBO frequency, type <b>&lt;ctrl-C X</b> to
get a <b>cmd:</b> prompt, then enter the command <b>PACTOR N8PGR</b> (for
example) to call the MBO station. If you connect, you will see a welcome
message and then a prompt like <b>"KE6RK de N8PGR&gt;"</b> and the link will
turn around so that you become the sending station.</font></font>

</p><p><font size="-1"><b><font face="Arial">Communicating with WinLink:</font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
The best place to start is by typing the <b>H</b> command (plus Enter after
each command), and WinLink will send back a command list. (Also in AirMail's
directory as WinLink.txt if you want to study ahead). WinLink handles all
changeovers, you don't need to do anything except type commands and text.
<b>LB</b> lists bulletins on file, another handy command. To send a message,
for example to your own email address, type <b>SP NEXUS</b>, wait for the
prompt for "email address:", type your email address, wait for the prompt
for "Subj/Msg:" then type a message subject followed by the text of your
short test message. End the message with <b>/EX</b> on a separate line.
When you are finished or bored type <b>B</b> (Bye) to quit. (Note that
these are all WinLink commands - if you want to send a command to a PTC-II
controller, hit the Esc key first to get a cmd: prompt (&lt;ctrl-C&gt; for
a KAM). But once linked to WinLink, you don’t want to be sending commands
to the controller).</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">If you need to initiate a disconnect
(something WinLink normally takes care of when you enter the <b>Bye</b>
command), for a PTC-II enter a <b>&lt;ctrl D&gt;</b> (or type Esc to get a
cmd: prompt, then DD to force a disconnect). For a KAM, enter <b>&lt;ctrl-C&gt;
X</b> to get a command prompt and then <b>A &lt;Enter&gt;</b> to abort the
link.</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">If all that works then your controller
is wired right and your transceiver is working. If there are troubles then
there's a couple of things to check: If the transmit power level is too
high (ALC off the scale) or too low then the transmit audio level needs
adjusting. The PTC-II transmit level is adjusted with the FSKA and PSKA
commands and KAM has a jumper (it's OK to check the manual on this). Also,
stray RF sometimes gets into the computer serial cable or the audio cable
to the transceiver. Adding one or more clip-on ferrites helps a lot as
we outlined above.</font></font>
