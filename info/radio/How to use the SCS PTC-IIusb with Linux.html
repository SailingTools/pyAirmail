<h4>How to use the SCS PTC-IIusb (and any other 'usb' tnc) with Linux / ftdi_sio kernel module</h4>
</center>
<h4><u>Introduction</u></h4>
I think it's safe to say that the RS232 serial port is slated for the 
history
books. Try and buy a PC today, and you'll probably notice it's all USB, 
and no
serial ports anymore. So how are we supposed to get our old TNC that 
still has
the RS232 serial port on it working ? The answer is in the form of a 
SERIAL to
USB adaptor. It lets you plug your old TNC into a USB equipped PC. If 
you have
never owned a TNC before, the new generation of TNC comes with USB only.
 In the case of SCS, they offer the PTC II-usb modem, a Pactor III power
 house. The firmware is still SERIAL, but they have put a SERIAL to USB 
convertor into the unit for you so you don't have to buy one. Just plug 
it into your USB equipped PC and you're ready to roll. All you need is 
something on the operating system side so that your old SERIAL 
applications can still function.
<br><br>
<font color="red">It's important to note that this article only applies 
to the type of USB TNC where the firmware is still written using SERIAL 
I/O - the manufacturer has just slapped a SERIAL to USB convertor inside
 the TNC. The firmware is still writing to a serial device. I think it's
 very important to make that distinguishment.</font>
<br><br>
I would expect some years from now (perhaps it's already being down by 
some TNC manufacturers) that the TNC firmware itself will use pure USB 
(no more serial conversion), in which case applications on the operating
 system side would have to switch to a pure USB api as well, removing 
the need for SERIAL to USB conversion. In the case of linux, one could 
use the <b>libusb</b> libraries, or write a kernel module instead.
<br><br>
Currently for linux, there is a kernel module called <b>usbserial</b> which includes another module called <b>ftdi_sio</b>,
 which when run, provides your old SERIAL applications (like minicom, 
Kptc, or JNOS 2.0) with a pseudo tty (/dev/ttyUSB0) that can be used to 
communicate with the TNC as if it was connected to a standard RS232 
serial port. When you plug a USB TNC (or a serial port equipped TNC with
 a serial to USB convertor) into the USB port on the linux PC, the 
kernel module is supposed to come up automatically and then you run your
 application using the pseudo tty device above.
<h4><u>SCS PTC II-usb requires patching the ftdi_sio kernel module source</u></h4>
You will need to install the kernel source for your particular kernel if
 you are to patch the ftdi_sio kernel module. I'll leave it to you to 
figure out how to do that. If you can't do that, then as far as I am 
concerned, you should not be patching a kernel to begin with. This is 
serious stuff, you don't want to mess up your operating system, and by 
compiling your own modules, you risk doing that. Once you have the 
source installed, follow along using my <b><u>example</u></b> below.
<br><br>
<font color="red">*** Pay attention to your current kernel version you are running and the file paths you use below !!!</font>
<br><br>
<b>1.</b> Find the correct source directory, in my case (fedora core 3 system) :
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-2.6.12/linux-2.6.12/drivers/usb/serial
<br><br>
<b>2.</b> Edit the file ftdi_sio.h, and add the following 8 lines :
<pre>#define FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_1_PID 0xD010   /* SCS PTC-IIusb */
#define FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_2_PID 0xD011   /* SCS Tracker / DSP TNC */
#define FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_3_PID 0xD012
#define FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_4_PID 0xD013
#define FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_5_PID 0xD014
#define FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_6_PID 0xD015
#define FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_7_PID 0xD016
#define FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_8_PID 0xD017
</pre>
AFTER the following line that already exists in the file :
<pre>#define FTDI_NF_RIC_PID 0x0001  /* Product Id */
</pre>
<b>3.</b> Edit the file ftdi_sio.c, and insert the following 8 lines :
<pre>        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_1_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_2_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_3_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_4_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_5_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_6_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_7_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_8_PID) },
</pre>
at the BEGINNING of the array initializers for the following 2 structure arrays that already exist in the file :
<pre>static struct usb_device_id id_table_FT232BM [] = 
static struct usb_device_id id_table_combined [] = 
</pre>
So AFTER you modify them, they should start out something like the following :
<pre>static struct usb_device_id id_table_FT232BM [] = {
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_1_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_2_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_3_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_4_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_5_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_6_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_7_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_8_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE_VER(FTDI_VID, FTDI_IRTRANS_PID, 0x400, 0xffff) },
        { USB_DEVICE_VER(FTDI_VID, FTDI_8U232AM_PID, 0x400, 0xffff) },
        ...
};

AND

static struct usb_device_id id_table_combined [] = {
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_1_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_2_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_3_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_4_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_5_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_6_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_7_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SCS_DEVICE_8_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_IRTRANS_PID) },
        { USB_DEVICE(FTDI_VID, FTDI_SIO_PID) },
        ...
};
</pre>
The SCS PTC-IIusb uses the FM232BM chipset - that's why we use that structure array.
<h4><u>Building the kernel module, and installing it</u></h4>
<b>1.</b> Change to the source root directory (on my fedora core 3 system) :
<pre> cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-2.6.12/linux-2.6.12
</pre>
<b>2.</b> Build the module (on my fedora core 3 system) :
<pre> make drivers/usb/serial/

* The trailing slash (/) is very important, don't forget it !
</pre>
<b>3.</b> Install the new ftdi_sio kernel module (on my fedora core 3 system) :
<pre> cp drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.ko /lib/modules/2.6.12-1.1381_FC3/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.ko
</pre>
<h4><u>That's it - you're ready to use your TNC via the pseudo tty</u></h4>
Tail the main log file, using the following command :
<pre>tail -f /var/log/messages
</pre>
Now plug your TNC into any USB port on your linux box. If all goes well, you should see something like this :
<pre>May 11 09:02:24 jedi kernel: usb 3-1: USB disconnect, address 3
May 11 09:02:30 jedi kernel: usb 3-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 4
May 11 09:02:31 jedi kernel: usbcore: registered new driver usbserial
...
May 11 09:02:31 jedi kernel: drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: USB Serial support registered for FTDI FT232BM Compatible
...
May 11 09:02:31 jedi kernel: ftdi_sio 3-1:1.0: FTDI FT232BM Compatible converter detected
May 11 09:02:31 jedi kernel: usb 3-1: FTDI FT232BM Compatible converter now attached to ttyUSB0
May 11 09:02:31 jedi kernel: usbcore: registered new driver ftdi_sio
May 11 09:02:31 jedi kernel: drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.c: v1.4.2:USB FTDI Serial Converters Driver
</pre>
Notice the /dev/ttyUSB0 - it's the device (tty) you use in your application. Try running minicom on it to test.
<h4><u>Application Note - specific to JNOS 2.0</u></h4>
For the linux version of JNOS 2.0, attach the SCS PTC-IIusb as an HF device :
<pre>#
# Attach a HFDD - SCS PTC-IIusb Pactor Modem
#
attach asy ttyUSB0 - hfdd ptc 4096 256 38400
#
ifconfig ptc desc "hf - Pactor on 20/30/40"
#
param ptc Pactor 1
#
</pre>
