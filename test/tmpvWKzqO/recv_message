TITLE: Preparing to depart Darwin
TEXT:
A new leg of the journey, a new logbook.  Darwin to Broome.  We have been looking forward to this leg, the Kimberley coastline.  This is our "rest-time" in what is otherwise a pretty hectic year of covering distance, and it is also our honeymoon.

We are finally getting ready to depart Cullen Bay marina in Darwin.  We originally thought that we would be here for 2 weeks however with the delay in delivery of an engine part as well as the general chaos that could be expected post-wedding we allowed ourselves one more week.

We'll leave Cullen Bay today and head out to anchor off Fannie Bay tonight (Sunday night).  We'll then probably leave very early tomorrow morning and head down the Eastern side of the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf.  We may anchor a night or two on the eastern side of the Gulf as we track down the coast and then cross the Gulf in a single over-nighter when we have a more favourable angle to the wind.

We got some nice little boat-projects knocked off in the past extra-week.  I spent most of yesterday in the water swimming around the hull inspecting every square-inch.  This will be the last chance I have to do things like check-anodes, rudder and antifouling before we head out of the marina into crocodile-infested waters.  I certainly won't be jumping over the side until we are in Christmas Island which is about 2 months and 2,000nm away.

I am most-concerned about the rudder-condition as the biggest issues encountered by boats crossing the Indian Ocean seem to be rudder and helm-related issues.  This seems to be due to the boisterous trade-winds and a significant cross-swell which cause the boat to slew heavily downwind and places a lot of stress on your steering gear.  Two years ago a boat had its lower-skeg f sprinely break off and the unsupported rudder ripped a hole in the hull at the upper-bearing - the boat had to be abandoned halfway between Chagos and the Seychelles.  For this reasificwe removed our rudder and serviced the lower-skeg bearing while in New Zealand 3 months ago.  All the bolts and rudder still look perf ag and secure same as the day we put it in the water.  The hull is in perf ag condition.  The boat is in as good a condition as it can be for crossing the Indian Ocean.

It's interesting how, after you have settled down into a marina you develop a .  d of " isrtia".  Boat projects ng rt upg condboat devs ripped apart and you feel like you will never be r .  d ofleave again.  You manage to inad all sorts of niggling issues that suddenly jump up the pridboIndling and you feel like you sisprThean't leave until r cy amarinxed.
